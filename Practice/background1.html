        <p>Co-working space provider WeWork has filed for bankruptcy. This comes after the company was reported to be in a state of flux amidst the current economic situation. The company, during its earnings report for the second quarter in August this year, had issued a warning hinting at not having enough expenses to sustain itself in the coming year. Various companies, including tech giants, were using WeWork to provide office spaces for their employees working remotely.

WeWork files for bankruptcy
Just last week, it was reported that WeWork shares fell by nearly 50 per cent and reports of a possible bankruptcy filing had surfaced online. On Tuesday, a Reuters report stated that WeWork has filed for bankruptcy. 60 per cent of the company is owned by the Japanese technology group SoftBank. It is to be noted that WeWork was once US' most-valued startup.

The report also added that the company was having trouble making money because it pays a lot of rent and businesses are canceling their subscriptions because some employees are working from home. Paying for space consumed 74 per cent of WeWork's revenue in the second quarter of 2023, the report revealed.

WeWork's co-founder, Adam Neumann, called the move "disappointing" in a statement, as per BusinessWire.
